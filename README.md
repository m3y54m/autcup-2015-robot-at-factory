# AUTCup 2015 @Factory Robot

This repository contains the source code and embedded design of our @Factory robot at AUTCup 2015 competitions.

The robot was designed and built by me and my friends at the University of Zanjan Robotics Association. We called our robot "FortyBot" due to the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the the University of Zanjan.

All the shared material in this repository are my work including:

- Design of all schematic and printed circuit boards of the robot
- Development of the emebedded program for navigation and controlling of the robot
